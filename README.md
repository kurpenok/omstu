# OmSTU AMCS training course solutions

## Attention!

Solutions to tasks can sometimes be incomplete
(especially those that were written closer to session).

We also recommend that you do not copy the algorithm code,
but rewrite it manually - this way the meaning is better understood.

Good luck and may God protect you!
