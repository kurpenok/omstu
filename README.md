# Solving the tasks of the OmSTU training course

### Attention! Solutions to tasks can sometimes be incomplete (especially those that were written closer to session).
### We also recommend that you do not copy the algorithm code, but rewrite it manually - this way the meaning is better understood.

### Good luck and may God protect you!

#### General information

This repository is intended for documenting solutions to problems from the training course of PMiFI FITiKS OmSTU.
